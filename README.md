# ColorDemo for iOS

This application is a demonstration of views, events and simple storage on the iOS platform. It was used
in a course at Technical School of Engineering in Jönköping, Sweden taught by Mikael Plate. Its purpose is
also to compare these operations to how they are done on the Android platform. Therefore, a corresponding
similar application is available for Android at https://github.com/mikeplate/colordemo-android.git
